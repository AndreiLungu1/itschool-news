                    News project



This project is a web-based news application that allows users to discover and access news in various categories. Using modern web development technologies, the project provides an intuitive and engaging experience for users. 

Main features

Dynamic homepage: On the app's homepage, users are greeted by a varied selection of news from all three major categories: technology, football and science. This initial overview provides ample context and allows users to explore diverse topics.

Intuitive navigation: To access more news about a particular category, users can use the navigation menu at the top of the page. Here, the categories are clearly organised, allowing users to quickly and easily find the information they are looking for.

Favourites functionality: The app allows users to add news to their list of favourites for quick access later. This functionality provides a personalised experience and allows users to save and revisit articles that have particularly interested them.
